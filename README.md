# CabInn 
## Project Description
Cabinn is a marketplace app for finding a rental cabin at a holiday destination of your choosing. The application allows a user to see all of the available cabins for rental, as well as see further details of an individual property. The user can then book a cabin, or leave a review for a cabin they have already booked. As a user you can also add a cabin to the database.
